A small collection of simple Python scripts I've written for a class.\\
datacommand: a small gui that allows for crud operations on data stored in a json file\
igetthepicture + heavylifter: a pair of scripts that will scrape a webpage and display all the images in a gui (note: the script will fail if a scraped image is a png or any other image this version of pysimplegui doesn't support)\
neumontscrape + scraper: a pair of scripts that will scrape the neumont academic calendar and display the events in a gui\
yeartoremember: a simple console application that quizzes the user and gives them a score (note: there is no way to end the script without finsing the game or closing the console/terminal\
